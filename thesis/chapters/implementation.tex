We have developed a prototype implementation\footnote{\urlgithub} of the Atomic Swap protocol outlined in~\cref{sec:atom:atomic-swap} in the Rust programming language between Bitcoin and the Grin Cryptocurrency.
On the Grin side we have been using the official grin-wallet\footnote{\urlgrinwallet} library and on the Bitcoin side the rust-bitcoin\footnote{\urlrustbitcoin} library for transaction creation, signing etc.
The choice of programming language was made on the basis that the official libraries available for the Grin Cryptocurrency are also written in Rust.
During development, we discovered two shortcomings in the grin-wallet library, which is why we used our own local forked version of this library in which we addressed those shortcomings.
We then submitted both changes to the library as pull requests.\footnote{\urlprone}\footnote{\urlprtwo}
To query blockchain state, submit and verify transactions our implementation sends JSON-RPC\footnote{\urljsonrpc} requests to a locally running Bitcoin Core and Grin Core node.
The developed program is executable via the command line and accepts the following commands:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{init}: The init command is run during the setup phase of the Atomic Swap.
    It creates a new swap slate consisting of a public file containing information about the offered currency, exchange rate, connection details and other public parameters and a private file in which secret keys and nonce values are stored.
    The public file can be shared with an interested party to execute a swap.
    \item \textbf{import}: The import command is run during the setup phase of the Atomic Swap and allows for the importing of funds both of the Bitcoin and the Grin side.
    Note that both parties need to import funds with a value of at least what is the desired value to be swapped before the protocol can continue.
    \item \textbf{accept}: The accept command is executed by an interested party during the setup phase.
    It imports the public slate file shared by the offering party and creates the respective private slate file, to which funds can be imported.
    \item \textbf{listen}: The listen command concludes the setup phase on the offerers side and starts a TCP server to which peers can connect to.
    The precondition for this command to execute is that the offered funds have been successfully imported into the swap slate.
    \item \textbf{lock}: The lock command starts the locking phase of the Atomic Swap.
    It is executed by the accepting party, while the offering party must already be listening on a TCP server.
    Again the command will verify that enough funds have been imported and will otherwise exit with an error.
    During this phase funds will be locked up on both chains as specified in~\cref{subsec:atom:locking}.
    Private and public slate files will be updated during this command to allow swap execution to be initiated.
    \item \textbf{execute}: The execute command runs the execution phase of the Atomic Swap~\cref{subsec:atom:exec} unlocking the funds locked during the locking phase and transferring the coins to their new owners.
    Again it has to be run by the accepting party while the offering party is still listening on a TCP server.
    Before the execution starts the program will check on both chains if enough time is left to finish the swap before the timeout would be hit.
    In the case that not enough time is left in at least one of the two blockchains the program will exit with an error.
    \item \textbf{cancel}: The cancel command returns funds that have been locked during locking phase to the original owners.
    The command will be executed by the accepting party, while the offering party is listening on a TCP server.
    Running the cancel protocol is only allowed as soon as the timeout has been hit on both blockchains.
    Trying to run the command earlier will result in an error.
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation Bitcoin side}\label{sec:ImplementationBtc}

On the Bitcoin side we have used a P2SH address to implement the locking mechanism.
We note here that in a practical setting it would be recommended to use a more efficient P2WSH\footnote{\url{https://bitcoincore.org/en/segwit_wallet_dev/}} (Pay to Witness Script Hash) address instead.
Because of the implementation just being a prototype we went more the slightly simpler P2SH version, however the same script can also be used with P2WSH address.
\Cref{fig:bitcoin-script} shows the locking script used on the Bitcoin side.
The script has two execution paths, depending on the number that is on the stack when the \textit{OP\_IF} command executes.
To make it evaluate to true one would have to push any number other then 0 to the stack, to make it evaluate to false one would have to push the number 0 to the stack.
If \textit{OP\_IF} evaluates to true we execute the refunding code.
\textit{OP\_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY} will cause the script to fail unless the nLockTime on the transaction is equal or greater then the value passed in \textit{<refund\_time>}.
This makes sure that this part of the script will only be executeable after a certain time, such that refunding is not possible prematurely.
(Note here that one has to set the nLockTime of the transaction which gurantees that it can only be mined after a certain time)
If the $\text{OP\_IF}$ evaluates to false we execute the redemption path of the script in which Alice needs to provide a valid signature under her public key and the statement $\varStatement$.

        }
        }

\section{Implementation Grin side}\label{sec:ImplementationGrin}

On the Grin side we have implemented the three transaction protocols specified in~\cref{sec:atom:protocols}.
Communication between the transacting parties happens via a TCP channel.
For the implementation of the two-party bulletproof range proofs we used the implementation provided in grinswap\footnote{https://github.com/vault713/grinswap} which runs a three round protocol between the two parties using the secp256k1-zkp\footnote{https://github.com/mimblewimble/secp256k1-zkp} library for bulletproof computation.

As already layed out in~\cref{sec:atom:atomic-swap} to lock the funds on the Mimblewimble side the two parties first engage in $\procDSharedOutputMwTxId$ transaction and then a timelocked $\procDSharedInpMwTxId$ refunding the coins to the original owner.
The timelock on Grin side can simply by achieved by setting the respective kernel feature of the transaction.
This refunding transaction is saved to the slate file for later use.
In the execution phase the $\procDScriptMwTxId$ transaction protocol is run and the result broadcast to the network sending the Grin to its new owner while revealing the witness value $\varWit$ to Alice, who is now able to build a valid spending script for the Bitcoin side.

\section{Evaluation}

We successfully managed to run the full protocol between Alice owning Grin and Bob owning Bitcoin on the Bitcoin and Grin testnets.
In transaction \\10536404873e6ae133afde600b5630d6a00f3be0b9dde01a248c6f13a00b3a4b\footnote{\url{https://tinyurl.com/pend7sdk}}, which was mined in block 1937148\footnote{\url{https://tinyurl.com/7jmryv47}} of the Bitcoin testnet 0.000016 BTC were locked in the lock address 2NCJDq4YRQ9C83fgvepMqU2D9kE4x7h36Ji\footnote{\url{https://tinyurl.com/2sz8munw}}.
On the Grin side our lock transaction locking 0.1 GRN was mined in block 718594\footnote{\url{https://floonet.grinscan.net/block/718594}} sending funds to the lock Commitment \\08c2e1a98f5fd328cc67b7df5ab9fdee9cf0c1c1f166d5d08a02a578945fdf6076\footnote{\url{https://tinyurl.com/y7ed5za5}}.
In the execution phase the locked funds on the Grin side where sent to Bob \\(09ef66334dc2e4c74732dafda8af3c32494eed5b23beb483d29d7ef32bf5c3ebb8\footnote{\url{https://tinyurl.com/ychtyf8v}}) in a contract transaction mined in block 718596\footnote{\url{https://floonet.grinscan.net/block/718596}}.
This allowed Alice to unlock her funds on the Bitcoin side in transaction \\ aa2ab77482841571b6413c68de681830c61527bc6a90ef1781d6208d151fea10\footnote{\url{https://tinyurl.com/45ysh9e4}} which was mined in block 1937150\footnote{\url{https://tinyurl.com/fddeahk8}} on the Bitcoin testnet.
Execution time of the protocol can be reduced to the time it takes for the individual transactions to be mined on the networks and is therefore depending on current network load as well as the miners fee included with the transaction, as transactions are prioritized according to their fees~\cite{kasahara2016effect}.
In a practical setting it is therefore unavoidable to estimate fees according to current network load and the Atomic Swap timeout.
Otherwise, it is possible that a redeeming transaction stays unconfirmed until the timeout is reached and the second party could try to refund the locked funs with a higher fee, outspending the redeeming transaction.
Another time consuming process of our implementation is the validation of locked funds on the Bitcoin side.
This has the reason that for importing a new address into a Bitcoin Core node, one has to rescan the blockchain which can take up to an hour.
To reduce this time it is possible to import the address without performing a rescan, however if the funding transaction was already mined in a block before the import command was executed, the transaction would be missed and the address would therefore appear empty.
A faster solution would be for instance to use the API of a block explorer such as\footnote{\url{https://blockstream.info/}}, however, this would introduce a trusted third party to the protocol, something that is generally to be avoided.
