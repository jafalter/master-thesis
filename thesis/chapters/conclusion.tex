This thesis aimed to improve interoperability between privacy-enhancing cryptocurrencies and regular cryptocurrencies, allowing for the listing of more privacy-enhancing currencies on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap.\footnote{\urluniswp}
We have achieved this goal by constructing an Atomic Swap protocol between Bitcoin and a Mimblewimble-based cryptocurrency.
Similar to JoÃ«l Gugger, who constructed an Atomic Swap protocol between Bitcoin and the Monero cryptocurrency in~\cite{gugger2020bitcoin}, we leveraged a Scriptless Scripts approach that was derived from Andrew Poelstra's inital work~\cite{poelstra2017scriptless} and the Adaptor Signature Scheme~\cite{aumayr2020bitcoinchannels} by Auymayr et al.
We further managed to prove Correctness and Security in the malicious setting for four different types of Mimblewimble transactions that allow for the distribution of Mimblewimble coins between multiple keys and the execution of simple contracts, based on our own secure and correct two-party version of the Adaptor Signature Scheme.
We pointed out a weakness in the security analysis of the Mimblewimble protocol done by Fuchsbauer et al. in~\cite{fuchsbauer2019aggregate}, which we have fixed by introducing the notion of Two-Party Signature Schemes into their model.
\todo[inline]{Pedro: I would like to go with you again through this. Please remind me in the next call}

While two-party signatures are prone to Rogue-key attacks, we demonstrate the infeasibility of such an attack in the Mimblewimble protocol.
