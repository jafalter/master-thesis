In this chapter, we will define a variant of the adaptor signature scheme as explained in section ~\ref{sec:pre:aptsignatures}.
The main difference in the protocol outlined in this thesis is that one of the two parties does know the fixed secret witness before the start of the protocol. The aim of the protocol will then be that the other person is able to extract the witness from the final signature.
This feature can then be leveraged to build an Atomic Swap protocol as we will show in ~\ref{ch:atomicswap}.

\todo[inline]{Points to clarify here:\\
- Why a new protocol for adaptor signatures is required?\\
- What are the advantages in practice of your protocol? }



The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. First we will define the general two-party signature creation protocol as it is currently implemented in Mimblewimble-based Cryptocurrencies.
We reduce the generated signatures to the general case~\cite{schnorr1989efficient} and prove its correctness. 
\todo[inline]{What is the general case? Explain}
From this two-party protocol, we then derive the adapted variant, which allows hiding a fixed witness value in the signature, which can be revealed only by the other party after attaining the final signature.
\todo[inline]{The witness value is revealed by the other party to whom? there are only two parties and the generator of the signature with the witness inside already knows the witness, right?}

We start by defining our extended signature scheme in section~\ref{sec:sig:definitions}, proceed by providing a schnorr-based instantiation of the protocol in section~\ref{sec:sig:schnorr-inst} and finally prove its security in section~\ref{sec:sig:two-party-apt-security}.

\todo[inline]{I would organize the content above in two paragraphs:\\
(a) one paragraph that contains the info about the fixed witness adaptor signature and the extensions\\
(b) A paragraph with the organization of the rest of the chapter.\\
I think you somehow have this content already but mixed with each other.

\todo[inline]{Editorial:\\
If you use ref{sth} for your citations, it only includes the number and you need to add Section, Figure, etc on your own. You can use cref{sth} instead and automatically adds the corresponding word (e.g., Section 5). You need to add the package cleveref for that.
