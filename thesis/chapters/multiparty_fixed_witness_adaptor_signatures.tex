In this chapter, we will define a variant of the Adaptor Signature Scheme as defined in ~\cref{def:pre:script:apt}.
This new variant is tailored specifically to meet the requirements of being applicable in the scenario of two-party signature protocols, constructable for Signature Schemes such as Schnorr~\cite{maxwell2019simple}.
In a two-party signature protocol each party holds only a share of a private key (to a composite public key) for which they want to cooperatively create a signature.
The advantage of our Adaptor Signature Scheme in comparison to the original definition is that in the two-party scenario mentioned above we do not need to introduce an additional pre-signature step.
Instead one of the partial signatures created and exchanged by the two parties will serve as what is defined as the pre-signature by Aumayr et al., allowing for a simpler protocol.
In particular our protocol will allow one of the two parties, to mask his signature share with a witness value $\varWit$ of $(\varWit, \varStatement) \opIn \cnstRelation$ (where $\cnstRelation$ is a hard relation as of \cref{def:pre:hard-relation}).
The second party (knowing $\varStatement$, but not $\varWit$) can verify that $\varWit$ is indeed contained in the partial signature received by the peer.
To complete the final signature the party knowing $\varWit$ has to first replace his partial signature (masked with $\varWit$) with the original unmasked version, which corresponds to the adapting step of the original Adaptor Signature Scheme~\cref{def:pre:script:apt}.
The second party, having previously received the masked partial signature is now able to extract $\varWit$ from the final signature, his own partial signature and the other parties masked partial signature.
This feature can then be leveraged to build an Atomic Swap protocol as we will show in~\cref{ch:atomicswap}.

The rest of the chapter is organized as follows:
First we will define the general two-party Schnorr signature protocol, as it is currently implemented in Mimblewimble-based Cryptocurrencies.
We will then show that the final signatures output by the protocol fulfill the same properties as regular Schnorr signatures seen in~\cite{schnorr1989efficient} and prove correctness of the protocol.
From this two-party protocol, we then derive the adapted variant already mentioned before.
We start by defining our extended Signature Scheme in~\cref{sec:sig:definitions}, proceed by providing a Schnorr-based instantiation of the protocol in ~\cref{sec:sig:schnorr-inst} and finally prove its correctness and security in~\cref{sec:sig:two-party-apt-security}.
